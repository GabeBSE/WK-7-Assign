             alt="A online gaming character named Kennen"><br>
             <p>
                Kennen, in my opinion, is one of the best champions to play. His game role is a mage that engages in
                ranged fights. He throws a shuriken from a distance.<br> You can build his abilities any way you choose 
                to fit your game style. You can build him as attack damage, carry, or a support tanky build by using 
                the build items<br> available inside the "in-game" store using the gold you earn throughout the match.

                But it is best to build Kennen as a mage, which is what his role is supposed to be.<br> His build could
                depend on the opponents you and your teammates are facing in each match. Or you could choose to 
                stick with a universal build. His abilities are magic-based,<br> so any magic items you buy that 
                have added magic will increase Kennen's special abilities. 
                
                Throughout the match, your team as 
                well as the enemy team will be building their champions,<br> increasing their health and whatever role-based 
                abilities they have. With the proper build and used correctly, Kennen could be very dangerous in a 
                one-on-one battle or even in a group battle.

            <li><b><u><i>Passive: Mark Of The Storm</b></i></u>: Kennen stuns enemies he hits 3 times with his abilities.</li>

            <li><b><i><u>Thundering Shuriken</b></i></u>: Kennen throws a fast moving shuriken towards a location,<br> causing 
                damage and adding a Mark of the Storm to any opponent that it hits.</li>

            <li><b><i><u>Electrical Surge</b></i></u>: Kennen passively deals extra damage and adds a Mark of the <br>Storm to 
                his target every few attacks, and he can activate this ability to damage and add<br> another 
                Mark of the Storm to targets who are already marked.</li>

            <li><b><i><u>Lightning Rush</b></i></u>: Kennen morphs into a lightning form, enabling him to pass through<br> units 
                and apply a Mark of the Storm. Kennen gains Move Speed when entering this form,<br> and attack 
                speed when leaving it.</li>

            <li><b><i><u>Slicing Maelstrom</b></i></u>: Kennen summons a storm that strikes at nearby enemy champions for<br> magical damage.</li>
